**Abstract** â€”The paper provides a detailed study about the business analysis of Staples. The company has corporate clients across the globe and is best in class in generating sales in furnishing products, home office accessories, electronics, and hard goods. The business model is analysed using the sales data of 2 years based on the unit orders generated by the employees, its gross profit margins, and country-wise distribution of earnings. To understand the business structure, an entity- relationship diagram is created for connecting matching data fields across various tables. The E-R diagram plays a crucial role in learning the data structure precisely. All the sections of the diagram are explained in a tabular format, which provides detailed information about the major data fields. The above- mentioned factors help implement the sales analysis of the organization.
